Progressive Web Application designed and developed to track marketing assets delivery in real time, build to support a guerrilla marketing campaign which required multiple assets to be installed over one weekend across UK. Application design was based on two use cases. Admin user with access to all routes and realtime updates on the delivery progress as well as ability do create and assign routes to drivers. Drivers on the other hand had access to routes assigned to them and were providing updates at each completed delivery.
