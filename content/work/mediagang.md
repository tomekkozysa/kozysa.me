I produced a Progressive Web Application for real-time delivery tracking. It was built to support a guerrilla marketing campaign with multiple assets to be installed over one weekend across the UK. 

Used by drivers and managers, the application gave real-time insight into production progress.
It was crucial that the application was responsive and worked across various mobile devices.

Each route consisted of seven deliveries, all seven needed to be completed before the route was fully delivered, closing the green progress circle.

I used the Vuetify UI library for the components and the visual language. It helped streamline the build and provided a consistent user experience.
Google Firebase API provided real-time synchronisation and user authentication.

Since the first campaign, the application has been fully adopted and become a crucial tool in Media Gang planning and production of their Guilerra marketing campaigns.
