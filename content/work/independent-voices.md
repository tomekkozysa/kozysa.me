The Independent invited my team to design a new online section based on a revised editorial approach focusing on the online debate.

We were required to work against a very short deadline. We had two weeks to complete the task.

Our task was to design a visual language that supports bold and dynamic communication across a full spectrum of editorial components and pages.

Just like a single article can be promoted using its elements in multiple configurations, we explored different ways of providing snippets of information. We used editorial cycles, user interactions and content types to identify the required components. 

Establishing a library of components was crucial to our layout explorations. It allowed a quick assembly of pages, ready for critique and discussion.

Adding a well-defined colour pallet and typography was the final step in this project.

::Testimonial
#quote
Nothing short of an inspiration to work with. At our initial meeting I laid out some broad principles for us to work to, which they adhered to superbly. The design they generated was extremely energetic, exciting, and unique, and throughout the consultation process both David and Tomek proved courteous, considerate, and highly competent. I would gladly go to them when designing a future website, and recommend that others do so too.
