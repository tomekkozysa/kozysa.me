<p>
I worked along a team of front and back end developers on a newly re-designed e-commerce website for this iconic brand. On the course of the project I contributed multiple components and responsive pages. Front end stack consisted of vue.js, tailwind and graphql. Project run across two repositories, one for the website and the second one for the library of components where we also used storybook to manage and test them. </p>

One of my main focus area was the User Profile section where all information related to the account could be accessed and modified. User dashboard contained multiple pages and like in the case of the wishlist implementing complex interactions. Address book utilised Google Places API.

Aside from developing User Dashboard, I have also developed multiple sidebar components, Store Changer that allowes users to change the country or the currency and most notably I have contributed Wishlist and Mini Bag components including interactions in between them.
