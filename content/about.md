I’m a freelance Interaction Designer with over 15 years of experience in the field of digital design. My professional experience is based in the creative environment, I have worked in media creative and advertising sectors.

I’m passionate about clean design and efficient code. I explore the similarities in between both disciplines which enables me to independently build prototypes and minimal viable products and test ideas and assumptions in the native environment. It also drives my interests in systems and systems theory.

I keep a tumblr blog on various systems at system-thinking.tumblr.com
